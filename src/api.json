You have one minute to convey what's on the card. Is it an animal? A person? An action? Just what is that word you're drawing?? If your team members just aren't getting it, try a different direction; you never know what kinds of clues might trigger the answer. You take turns drawing, so all players get to channel their inner artists! Don't worry if 'can't draw', the game can be even funnier, and the laughs just keep coming! Two levels of clues (120 adults, 80 junior) make this a great game for both kids and adults! Year after year since 1985, Pictionary has proven itself to be the ultimate party game!",
